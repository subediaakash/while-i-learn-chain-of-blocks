- Data origin authentication
- Non Repudiation  : a service that offers definitive proof that a particular activity has occurred .

-Accountability : assurance which states that actions affecting security can be traced back to the responsible party.

Cryptographic Primitives : Keyless Primitives , Symmetric Primitives , Assymetric Primitives

 	- Keyless : Random Numbers ,Hash Funcs
	- Symmetric Primitives : Secret key ciphers , Macs
	- Asymmetric Primitives : Digital Signatures , Public Key ciphers

Symmetric Cryptography : same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data .Ex: DES, AES (block ciphers)
	Stream Ciphers : encryption algos applied on a bit by bit basis. They are  simple moduloe  2 additions / XOR operations 
		Types : Syncronous and Async
		Syncronous : Dependent only on the key
		Asyncronous : depended on key and encrypted data
	Block Ciphers : Breaks up the texts into blocks of fixed size and then perform encryption
		Cipher block chaining : each block of plain text is XOR'd with the previously encrypted block.

	Cryptographic hash node : block ciphers are used as a compression function  to produce a hash of a plain text
